# Roadmap AI – Your Personal Career Guide

## What It Is
Roadmap AI is an online platform that helps students discover the career path that best fits their interests and strengths. By answering a short, fun questionnaire, the AI analyses the responses and instantly creates a personalized learning roadmap – a step‑by‑step plan that shows which skills to learn, which projects to try, and how long each stage might take.

## Why It Matters
Choosing a specialty can be overwhelming, especially when you don’t know which subjects match your passions. Roadmap AI removes the guesswork:
- **Instant insight** – get a clear recommendation in seconds.
- **Tailored learning plan** – see a visual roadmap with milestones, resources, and practical projects.
- **Bilingual support** – the whole experience works in Azerbaijani and English.

## Who It’s For
- High‑school and university students looking for direction.
- Career counselors who need a quick, data‑driven suggestion tool.
- Anyone curious about what the future could look like based on their interests.
